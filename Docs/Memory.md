## Key Decisions Made üéØ

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Design System**: Destilj.css (selected from provided options)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (existing structure)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with RLS)
- **Styling**: Tailwind with custom Destilj variables

### Architecture Choices
- SPA (Single Page Application) approach
- Component-based architecture
- Real-time data updates via WebSocket/SSE
- Row-level security for multi-tenant data
- Background job processing for data ingestion

### Design Decisions
- Brutalist/minimalist aesthetic from Destilj
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Privacy-focused UI messaging
- Business-oriented color scheme and typography

## Blockers & Dependencies üö´

### Critical Blockers
1. **Supabase Setup**: Requires clicking "Connect to Supabase" button
2. **Backend Development**: FastAPI endpoints need implementation
3. **Database Schema**: Tables and relationships need creation
4. **External APIs**: GDELT, weather, geocoding service setup

### Development Dependencies
- Authentication service (JWT implementation)
- Real-time data pipeline
- Background job processing (Redis)
- Payment integration (Stripe)
